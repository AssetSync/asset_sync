      Rails 3.1.1 Compatability

Test if config/initializers/asset_sync.rb exists and load that, otherwise provide a default initializer that is configurable with environment variables. Then merge in settings if config/asset_sync.yml is found. Add the asset_sync.rake in to lib/tasks so it is autoloaded and don't bother generating it anymore
